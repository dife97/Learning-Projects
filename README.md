# Learning-Projects
Hello, you! 👋  
Here's the summary of the projects I developed since I started learning iOS Developement. They were all developed using Storyboard at first place, but right now I am refactoring all of them to UIKit programmaticaly (Viewcode). Take a look :)  


## 💪 [BMI-Calculator](https://github.com/dife97/Learning-Projects/tree/main/BMI-Calculator)
#### The app calculates the BMI for a given height and weight. 
- Dependecy Injection;
- Reusable view for the Slider component;
- Unit Test for the BMI result.

## 🌧 [Clima](https://github.com/dife97/learning/tree/main/Clima)
- Delegation pattern; 
- URLSession for the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current);
